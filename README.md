# PyStorm

This repo will contain a Python wrapper around StormLib (a library for manipulating the MPQ archives as used by Blizzard's games). It is currently in a very incomplete state and only developed as far as currently required for my Starcraft II level editing needs.

Currently it can:

- create a new archive
- add existing files to that archive
